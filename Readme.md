The objective of this project is to design a web scraper (or crawler) to help with job search on specific sites.
The idea is to develop a script which will crawl the career sections of specific (pre-defined) websites and get info about job postings.
It will search in a regular interval and provide updates on added jobs.
Functionality should be there to add keywords and other filters in the job search.
